This is a community for writers and readers of rational and rationalist fiction.

Rational fiction is fiction where the characters act as real humans would.

Fiction which is driven by a conflict in values, not by 'evil' villians with contrived personas. Where the antagonists would kill the protagonist in the first chapter if they could.

Fiction where heroes don't succeed based on improbable luck or magical brilliance. In our world, Sherlock Holmes would fail as a detective - he operates by magically finding the right clues and magically carrying out complicated chains of deducation. In our world, most clues are meaningless and most guesses are wrong.

Fiction where nobody important is stupid, and where the characters that are smart actually are, not just described as being so.

Rational fiction is fiction that tries to make sense as much as it tries to tell a good story. While some suspension of disbelief may be needed - neither magic nor timetravel is possible - the world will be internally consistent.

For a quick peak, take a look at [Lord of Rationality](http://hpmor.com/chapter/64#storycontent), a snippet of a rational take on The Lord of The Rings.

## Characteristics of Rational Fiction:

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
- Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
- The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
- The main character uses (or tries to use) rationalist and scientific methods to demystify seemingly mysterious phenomena.
- The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers.
- The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.
